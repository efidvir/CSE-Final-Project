abstract="In a previous paper1, the authors discussed two methods for image construction by computer from ultrasonic data. The first method involved recording the intensity distribution of ultrasonic holograms, and using this data in a computer simulation of the wavefront reconstruction procedure of holography2. The second involved recording the amplitude and phase of the ultrasonic wavefront and computing the image directly by backward propagation3. Successful reconstructions were obtained by both methods, but the backward propagation technique, which permits a considerable reduction in the spatial frequency bandwidth (and therefore computer time) required, seemed the more promising for further effort. Reconstructions using the backward propagation method have also been reported by Sondhi9.",

Two practical migration schemes utilizing this concept are developed in this paper. One scheme extends the Claerbout finite difference method, greatly reducing dispersion problems usually associated with this method at higher dips and frequencies. The second scheme effects a Fourier transform in both space and time; by using the full scalar wave equation in the conjugate space, the method eliminates (up to the aliasing frequency) dispersion altogether. The second method in particular appears adaptable to three-dimensional migration and migration before stack.}",
